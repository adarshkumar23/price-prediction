# Deep Learning regression using Tensorflow for house prices prediction.

## About the repository
The main goal of this work is to use the low level Tensorflow core API and build a deep learning regression model, to use the competitions dataset that has a lot of features and lots of missing values as well.

As this repository uses Tensorflow core API, it may seems a little too much code to people who is used the Keras or any other high level implementation framework.

### House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data

### Overview
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

### Acknowledgments
The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset.
